Countries.app

This sample demonstrates the following concepts: HTTP GET Request, JSON.

Tap the window and a country is randomly displayed.

The code gets very simple by using BubbleWrap(https://github.com/mattetti/BubbleWrap), wrappers and helpers for RubyMotion.

Countries list is taken from World Countries API(http://www.geognos.com/geo/en/world-countries-API.html).
