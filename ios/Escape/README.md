While playing around with some ideas for [Coderdojo Cologne](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/385) lessons,
I found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1wc0yi/made_a_small_game_with_spritekit_this_is_my_code/) by [@StevenVeshkini](https://github.com/StevenVeshkini/).
So I decided to port it to  [Rubymotion](http://www.rubymotion.com) iOS and Mac OS X. At the end I hope to write this or similar games with the kids and 
our next [Coderdojo Cologne](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/385).

Thanks to [Steven Veshkini](https://github.com/StevenVeshkini/) for giving his code for free to ALL.
